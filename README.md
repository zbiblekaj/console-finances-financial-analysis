# console-finances-financial-analysis

Welcome to my latest JavaScript project where I will be analyzing financial data for Console Finances. 

I have been given a dataset composed of two fields: Date and Profit/Losses. My task is to write JavaScript code that will analyze the records to calculate several key financial metrics including:
- The total number of months included in the dataset. 
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period. 
- Average changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period by tracking what the total change in profits is from month to month and finding the average.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, as well as the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

My goal is to create a robust financial analysis tool that can be used to make data-driven decisions and provide valuable insights for Console Finances.
