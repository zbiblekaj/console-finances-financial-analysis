Pseudocode for console finances: 

1. create a header for the console log before beginning calculations 
- console log the title you would like
- console log underscore so that there is a seperation between the title and calculations.

2. calculate the total number of months included in the data set: add the total amount of months for the period.
- initialize a variable for the total number of months
- console log the total months 

3. calculate the total amount of profit/losses for the entire period: add the total amount of figures for the period.
- initialize a variable for the total amount of profit & losses
- initialize a function to sum the total amount of figures
- within the function, use a for loop to define the figures needed to be summed 
- console log the total amounts.

4. Track the total change in proits from month to month and then find the average (totalPL / totalMonths)
- initizialize a variable for the total average of changes & each change 
- create a for loop for the addition of the changes
- console log the total amount. 

5. Calculate the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
This is the greatest value of the average of changes calculated previously. Month, year & amount.
- intiizialize a variable for the greatest increase.
- use the math function to calculate the greatest increase of the changes calculated above

6. Calculate the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
This is the smallest value of the data set.
- intiizialize a variable for the greatest decrease.
- use the math function to calculate the greatestdencrease of the changes calculated above
