Pseudocode for console finances: 

1. create a header for the console log before beginning calculations 
- console log the title you would like
- console log underscore so that there is a seperation between the title and calculations.

2. calculate the total number of months included in the data set: add the total amount of months for the period.
- initialize a variable for the total number of months
- create a for loop to add the total amount of months 
- console log the total months 

3. calculate the total amount of profit/losses for the entire period: add the total amount of figures for the period.
- initialize a variable for the total amount of profit & losses
- initialize a function to sum the total amount of figures
- within the function, use a for loop to define the figures needed to be summed 
- console log the total amounts.

4. 

Add the total amount of figures for the period using a for loop & a function. 

- Calculate the average of the changes in profile/lossess over the entire period.
To calculate an average of a total of scores, you would add all of the numbers and divide by the total amount of figures. This is the first figure divided by the second figure.  

- Track the total change in proits from month to month and then find the average



- Calculate the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
This is the greatest value of the average of changes calculated previously. Month, year & amount.

- Calculate the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
This is the smallest value of the data set.
